## 🎯 Benefits of Removal

1. **Cleaner Interface** - Less cluttered tables
2. **Faster Scanning** - Focus on essential data
3. **Better Mobile UX** - More space for important info
4. **Simplified Forms** - Easier to add expenses/income
5. **Still Flexible** - Notes field available for additional details

## ⚠️ Note

The **Notes** field is still available for users who want to add extra details. The main difference:
- **Description** (removed) - Was required, separate field

Users can now use the **Notes** field for what was previously in the Description field.
